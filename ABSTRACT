DANDY-Dual-stage-Appliance-level-NILM-and-Diffusion-sYstem

ABSTRACT
Traditionally, NILM (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring) has been
proposed to help save around 12% of annual electricity
consumption by highlighting which appliance is active. In this
paper, we seek to extend and refine this methodology by
incorporating Appliance Anomaly Detection. We created DANDY
(Dual-stage Appliance-level NILM and Diffusion sYstem) to
identify a single anomalous appliance out of the aggregate
electricity consumption of three appliances (Fridge, Dishwasher,
WashingMachine). In contrast, traditional methods are restricted
to an aggregate or an appliance-by-appliance approach. Our
first component is a NILM model that combines Autoencoder,
Cosine Similarity, and Decision Tree to perform a time series
classification of “ON” / “OFF” based on a month of Smart Plug usage.
Following this is the Diffusion Anomaly Detection model that
identifies if a pattern is “Normal” or “Anomaly”. This framework
can identify contextual anomalies and bypass the traditional and
trivial 3-sigma threshold anomaly detection. Our analysis consists
of fourteen datasets (7xREFIT, 3xUKDALE, 3xGREEND, 1xAMPds2), seven
anomalous days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday), and seven synthetic anomalies (StepChange,
MultiStepChange, Mirror, Repeating, StuckMAX, StuckMIN, and
PowerCycling). We compare across six algorithms: 3-Sigma, Isolation
Forest, DBSCAN, Autoencoder, COCA, and Diffusion. We achieved
promising values for Appliance Accuracy and Anomaly Accuracy. Our
project is not limited to success only in the residential sector.
It may also find direct application in the commercial, manufacturing,
and industrial sectors, as well as in IoT (Internet of Things),
whereby the objective is proactive monitoring and identification
of anomalous equipment out of a time series composite set.
